/**
 * @brief Monitor task deadlines by assigning a software watchdog to each
 *        periodic task.
 * @note The current implementation doesn't really support monitoring
 *       "non-periodic" tasks (e.g. CAN TX).
 * @note Some hints for setting up the hardware watchdog in STM32CubeMX:
 *       - Use __HAL_DBGMCU_FREEZE_IWDG to stop the IWDG clock when the CPU is
 *         halted due to a breakpoint, or else the IWDG can likely trigger an
 *         undesirable system reboot.
 *       - Create User Constants in STM32CubeMX with the following values:
 *
 *             IWDG_WINDOW_DISABLE_VALUE = 4095
 *             LSI_FREQUENCY             = <LSI Clock Frequency in Hertz.
 *                                          For example, it is 40000 for
 *                                          STM32F302R8.>
 *             IWDG_PRESCALER            = 4
 *             IWDG_RESET_FREQUENCY      = 5
 *
 *         ...then set the following parameters for "Watchdog Clocking" under
 *         "Parameter Settings" for IWDG:
 *
 *            IWDG counter clock prescaler   = 4
 *            IWDG window value              = IWDG_WINDOW_DISABLE_VALUE
 *            IWDG down-counter reload value = LSI_FREQUENCY / IWDG_PRESCALER
 *                                             / IWDG_RESET_FREQUENCY
 *
 *         In case it was not clear, IWDG_RESET_FREQUENCY = 5 means that the
 *         IWDG has a frequency of 5Hz, or a period of 200ms.
