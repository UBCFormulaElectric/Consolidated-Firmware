# jsoncan

jsoncan is a project to generate embedded CAN drivers and a CAN DBC file from JSON data. To modify the CAN bus,
developers will only need to modify the JSON data, and the CAN drivers and DBC will be auto-generated upon building.

This will replace the old system where CAN drivers were auto-generated from a developer-edited DBC file.

## Schema Documentation

For documentation the JSON schema, read the `docs` folder.

## Code Overview

The main entry point is `generate_can_from_json.py`, and the paths to input JSON data and output autogenerated code are
provided as arguments. Use `run_example.sh` to run with the example JSON data.

`generate_can_from_json.py` does the following:

1. Parses the JSON data, see `src/json_parsing/json_can_parsing.py`. There is some JSON schema validation (see
   `src/json_parsing/schema_validation.py`) and error checking.
2. `json_can_parsing.py` generates a `CanDatabase` object. This is a language-independent description of a CAN bus (
   nodes, messages, and signals).
3. Generate a DBC file from the CAN database (`src/dbc_generation`).
4. Generate embedded C files (all C generation Python lives in `src/codegen/c_generation`).

The generated C files are:

1. `io_canTx.h/c`: Functions for sending messages, at certain cycle times and asynchronously. Pulls the signal values to
   send from the CAN TX table in `app_canTx.h/c`.
2. `app_canTx.h/c`: Holds the CAN TX table, a big struct to hold the current data that is to be transmitted on the bus.
3. `io_canRx.h/c`: Functions for receiving messages. One for filtering a message by ID (i.e. deciding if this node
   should respond) and another for unpacking a received message into the CAN RX table.
4. `app_canRx.h/c`: Holds the CAN RX table, a big struct to hold the current data that was received from the bus.

## Examples

Consider the folder test/valid_json. This folder contains the json configuration used in the tests. It is representative
of the range of configurations that are allowed.
