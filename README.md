# Consolidated-Firmware
A consolidated repository for gathering all firmware under one roof. 

## Python Setup
We use python both for CI (see below), and to generate C code from the `.dbc` defining messages passed over CAN. Python dependencies are managed via [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). To install all required dependencies in a [python virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/), navigate to the root of this repository and run `pipenv install`.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

We run (and require) continuous integration on every pull request before it is merged. This automatically makes sure the code builds, and checks for formatting errors.

### Running Continuous Integration on Your Local Machine

You may want to run CI on your local machine (for example, to debug why your code does not pass it). Please follow the below steps to do so:

1. **Install Dependencies**: There are several dependencies required in order to mimic what CI is doing. *(Note: All links below are for windows. All equivalent linux utilities may be easily installed via the package manager for your linux distribution (`apt-get` in Ubuntu, etc.))*
  * GNU Make: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
  * CMake: https://cmake.org/install/
  * Python 3+ (*Python < 3 will NOT work*): https://www.python.org/downloads/
  * ARM GNU Embedded Toolchain: https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads
2. **Modify your `PATH` Environment Variable**: Make sure to add the binary executables to `PATH`. To add these, find `Environment Variables` in your start menu and then add the appropriate paths to `PATH`:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Tools Arm Embedded\<VERSION>\bin
C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin
...
```
(*These paths should include wherever the `cmake`, `make`, and `GCC` binaries have been installed.*)

3. **Running CI - Build Check**: Run the following commands (starting from the **root directory** of this repository) to build the code as CI does:
  * *Windows:*
  ```
  cd src
  pipenv run cmake CMakeLists.txt -G "MSYS Makefiles"
  make
  ```
  * *Linux:*
  ```
  cd src
  pipenv run cmake CMakeLists.txt
  make
  ```
4. **Running CI - Formatting Check**: Run the following commands (starting from the **root directory** of this project) to fix formatting (CI runs this and then checks if it did anything) does:
  * *Windows and Linux:*
  ```
  python clang_format/fix_formatting.py
  ```

#### CommentPragmas
In `.clang-format`, the line `CommentPragmas: '\/\*(\*(?!\/_|[^*])*\*\/'` is ineffective because it's being preempted by `ReflowComments`. We are hoping that the next version of `clang-format` will resolve this.

## CMakeLists
- Each board project (e.g. PDM, FSM) shall have its `CMakeLists.txt` and linker directives generated by a **STM32CubeMX** project in **CLion**. Here is a guide: https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2019/02/clion-2019-1-eap-clion-for-embedded-development-part-iii/.
- Where applicable, compile each shared library folder to its own static library (e.g. `.a` file). The developer is responsible for writing their own `CMakeLists.txt` for the static library.
