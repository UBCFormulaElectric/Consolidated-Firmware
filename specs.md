# Module Specifications

*This set of specifications is for the **2019** rules, which may be found [here](http://www.fsaeonline.com/cdsweb/gen/DownloadDocument.aspx?DocumentID=607667ea-bec6-4658-92c4-fff59dbb5c0e)*

This Markdown file contains the specifications for each module. The intent is to have a definitive resource that fully defines all board behaviors, as observed from outside the board.
Each specification has an unique ID, short title, and detailed description. It may also be associated with a competition rule.

## Specification Rules
1. Specification ID's should never be duplicated.
1. Specification ID's should only increment. This means that even if have 50 FSM specs and we delete `FSM-23`, the next spec should be `FSM-51`, we should never re-use ID's.
1. Specification descriptions should be unambiguous and formal. Instead of "acceptable value" say "5 V". Instead of "shall send out error constantly", say "shall send out the CAN message `ERR_CAN_MSG` every 4 seconds until the board is reset".
1. All abbreviations (`AIR`, `APPS`, etc.) should be spelled out fully the first time they appear in a given row in the table. This means that if `APPS` appears in `FSM-0` and `FSM-22`, it should be spelled out as `APPS (acceleration pedal position sensor)` in _both_ `FSM-0` and `FSM-22`.

## Background Info
There are two types of faults:
    - Critical Faults:
        - AIR shutdown: requires an AIR shutdown and a motor shutdown
        - Motor shutdown: requires a motor shutdown only
    - Non-critical:
        - All other faults, for logging and debugging purposes

--- | --- | --- | ---
FSM-0 | Startup CAN message | The FSM must transmit a startup message over CAN on boot.
FSM-1 | Heartbeat sending | The FSM must transmit a heartbeat over CAN at 100Hz.

FSM-4 | APPS mapping | - The FSM must map the primary APPS position to pedal travel percentage linearly with dead zones on both the low and high ends of the APPS position. <br/> - The low end dead zone boundary must be defined as 1.5 multiplied by the maximum encoder reading when the pedal is completely depressed. <br/> - The high end dead zone boundary must be experimentally determined to ensure the FSM can send 100% pedal travel despite any mechanical deflection in the pedal box.
FSM-5 | APPS open/short circuit | If there is an open/short circuit in either encoder the FSM must report 0% pedal travel. | T.6.2.2, T.6.2.9

FSM-8 | Steering angle reporting | - The FSM must report the steering angle in degrees over CAN at 100Hz, where 0 degrees represents straight wheels and a clockwise turn of the steering wheel corresponds to an increase in steering angle. <br/> - The FSM must send a non-critical fault when the steering angle is beyond the max turning radius of the steering wheel.
FSM-9 | Wheel speed reporting | - The FSM must report the two front wheel speeds in km/h over CAN at 100Hz. <br/> - The FSM must send a non-critical fault when either front wheel speed is below -10km/h or above 150km/h.
