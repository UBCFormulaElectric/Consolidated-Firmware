# CanMsgs
This folder contains everything to do with the CAN messages that we send between controllers on the car. 

## Contents
 - `CanMsgs.sym`: defines all the CAN messages on the car
 - `generate_c_code_from_sym.py`: this script generates `CanMsgs.c` and `CanMsgs.h` from `CanMsgs.sym`, allowing us a C interface to all the CAN messages

 ## Making Changes to CAN Messages
 1. Edit the `.sym` using `PCAN-View` (which is free to download)
 1. Run `generate_c_code_from_sym.py` to generate the update `CanMsgs.c` and `CanMsgs.h` files.

 ## Working With The Generated C Code
 For every CAN message (hereafter generally referred to as `MSG_NAME`), there will be:
 - `CanMsgs_MSG_NAME_t`: a struct that is setup to hold the various elements of the message
 - `CanMsgs_MSG_NAME_pack`: a function to pack the `CanMsgs_MSG_NAME_t` struct into a data array that we can transmit over CAN  
 - `CanMsgs_MSG_NAME_unpack`: a function to unpack a given data array into a `CanMsgs_MSG_NAME_t` struct 

 There are other functions in `CanMsgs.h`, but in almost all cases these should **not** be used.

 ## Reserved Ranges
 *These are ranges that have already been reserved for specific purposes/boards. They should _not_ be used for **anything** other then their intended purpose.
- `0x00 to 0x1F` (**BMS**): CAN messages sent from the BMS
- `0x20 to 0x3F` (**DCM**): CAN messages sent from the DCM
- `0x40 to 0x5F` (**FSM**): CAN messages sent from the FSM
- `0x60 to 0x7F` (**PDM**): CAN messages sent from the FSM
- `0x80 to 0x9F` (**Shared**): general CAN messages that could be sent from anywhere
- `0x190 to 0x19F` (**BAMOCAR Tx**): CAN messages sent from our BAMOCAR inverter 
- `0x210 to 0x21F` (**BAMOCAR Rx**): CAN messages received by our BAMOCAR inverter
